# Link Program

This is where you would put your cheat code if you were to use this project. 
All this is, is just a program that uses the api of the webgui in a program.
This can be recoded into any language that your cheat may use.

# Before you use:

Make sure to edit the yoursite variable if you are not running off localhost.
Make sure to add ssl verifiction, this makes it so autoresponders dont work against your cheat. *SSL verification checks if the request you sent to the site is actually being responded to by your webgui and not a pastebin or smthn.
